## Fake News Detection using CNN and Attention 

**Project description:** The explosive growth in fake news and its influence in democracy, justice, and public trust has increased the demand for fake news analysis, detection and intervention. There are variety of approaches and methods for tackling this task such as credibility based detection, feature based detection, propagation based detection and feedback based detection. In this project I used text of news, besides news' metadata for fake news detection. I proposed a hybrid convolutional-attentive model that takes use of text statements and meta-datas with more attention on the important parts of the text statements to detect fake news. I evaluated the model by reporting accuracy, f1, and other metrics and showed that the proposed model can slightly enhance the performance of the baseline model.
