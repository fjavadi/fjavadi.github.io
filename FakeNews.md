## Fake News Detection using CNN and Attention 

**Project description:** The explosive growth in fake news and its influence on democracy, justice, and public trust has increased the demand for fake news analysis, detection and intervention. In this project, I used text of news, alongside with news' metadata such as speaker, speaker's job, and party for fake news detection. I proposed a hybrid convolutional-attentive model that takes use of text statements and meta-datas. The proposed model doesn't treat all parts of news uniformly but it tries to focus on the important parts of the text statements to detect fake news. I evaluated the model by reporting accuracy, f1, and other metrics and showed that the proposed model can slightly enhance the performance of the baseline model.
