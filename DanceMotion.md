## Dance Motion Transfer

**Project description:** In our project, given a source video of a person dancing, we want to transfer the dance motion to an amateur target performing some standard moves. There are lots of application for this work in advertisement or film industry. We approach this problem as a video to video translation using pose as an intermediate representation. To transfer the motion, we extract poses from the source subject and apply the learned pose to appearance mapping to generate the target subject. For the background, as opposed to the baseline model we use the source video, due to having more realistic features.
