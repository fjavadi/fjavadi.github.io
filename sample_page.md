## Hierarchical Part-based Disentanglement of Pose and Appearance

**Project description:** Learning image representations is a crucial task in Computer Vision. But common methods for this task lack interpretability, providing representation for an image as a whole, in a way that we don't what information has been encoded in each part of the represenation vector. Our goal in this project is to learn interpretable represantation for images. We are specifically interested in encoding the parts that form an image, then for each part we learn its disentangled shape and appearance, and also learning the hierarchy of detected parts. Learned representations are general purpose and could be used in many tasks, such as Pose and Appearance Transfer, or Landmark Detection.
